Switch topology:

   | | |

Input parameters:
1. Ospf csv file (Mandatory)

Sample Hosts file:
# This is the Ansible inventory/hosts file
[switch]
gui-spine1 ansible_host=10.9.21.60

Sample ospf csv file:
# switch_name, l3_port, my_ip, area_id
gui-spine1, 9, 10.1.1.1/30, 0

Description:
1. This playbook create vrouters, assign loopback-ip, creates l3-interfaces and configure ospf neighborship with data specified in the respective csv files.
2. The vrouter_name used has format : (switch_name + ‘-vrouter’)
3. The vnet_name used has format: (fabric_name + ‘-global’)
4. Vrouter creation command:
vrouter-create name %s vnet %s
    if vrrp_id:
        hw-vrrp-id %s
enable router-type hardware
(Values for vrouter_name and vnet_name is taken from point 2,3 and vrrp_id is taken from playbook as an user input.)
5. Loopback assigning command:
vrouter-loopback-interface-add vrouter-name %s ip %s
(Value for vrouter_name is taken from point 2 and loopback-ip is taken from the playbook as an user input.)
6. Vrouter interface add command:
vrouter-interface-add vrouter-name %s ip %s l3-port %s
(Value for vrouter_name is taken from point 2 and value for interface_ip and l3_port is taken from the csv file.
7. Vrouter ospf-add command:
vrouter-ospf-add vrouter-name %s network %s ospf-area %s
(Value for vrouter_name is taken from point 2 and value for network and ospf_area is taken from the csv file.

Note:
1. Make sure you have only one switch listed under [switch] section in hosts file.
2. Ospf csv files input are mandatory.
3. Make sure switch names in ospf csv file matches with switch name mentioned in hosts file.
4. Make sure that the interface_ip has a subnet(e.g.: 10.1.1.1/30)

Notes regarding working of vrouter_creation task:
1) There are 2 arguments taken from the csv file.
   pn_loopback_ip, pn_vrrp_id
2) Both the parameters corresponds to respective functionality as below:
   pn_loopback_ip: to assign router_id and assign loopback_ip
   pn_vrrp_id: to assign hw-vrrp-id to the vrouter
3) If we want any functionality to be configured then uncomment those parameters from the playbook otherwise comment them.
   Commenting the parameter will not configure the respective functionality.
   e.g.: if we comment pn_loopback_ip in the playbook and uncomment pn_vrrp_id then the modules will not assign loopback_ip or router_id, only vrrp_id will get assigned and similarly other cases.
