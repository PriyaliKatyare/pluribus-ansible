       - Assign router_id
       - Create leaf_cluster
        EBGP:
          - Assigning BGP_AS, BGP_REDISTRIBUTE, BGP_MAXPATH
          - Assign eBGP_neighbor
          - Add iBGP neighbor for clustered leaf
        OSPF:

Steps/Commands:

1. Find all the vrouters already created through other modules like l3-vrrp and l3-ztp
Command: vrouter-show format name no-show-headers

NOTE: The vrouter list found in this step is used in various other functions in this module


2. Assign router id to the routers. The loopback ip assigned in l3-ztp module is used as the router id. For that we perform the following steps sequentially:
   2.a. Find the loopback ip assigned
          Command: vrouter-loopback-interface-show vrouter-name %s format ip no-show-headers
   2.b. Assign the loopback ip from step 2.a. as router-id
          Command: vrouter-modify name %s router-id %s
          Output msg: Added router id %s to %s


3. Create leaf clusters if 2 leafs are directly connected. The following steps are performed:

   3.a. Find all the leafs which are not in cluster currently. (l3-vrrp may have formed some leaf clusters)
          i) Find all the cluster nodes already present in some cluster.(l3-vrrp may have formed some leaf clusters)
             Command: cluster-show format cluster-node-1,cluster-node-2
          ii) Find the difference of the leaf-list and cluster-node-list(@ref point 3.a.i) to get the non-cluster-leaf-list

   3.b. Select a leaf(switch_1) from the non-cluster-leaf-list(obtained above), and remove it from the non-cluster-leaf-list.
        Now, we find the switches directly connected to the selected leaf(switch_1) as follow:
         i) Find the directly connected nodes
            Command: switch %s lldp-show format sys-name
         ii) Find all the switches in the fabric
             Command: switch %s fabric-node-show format name
         iii) Find the difference between the list from i and ii and store in a list. This step is performed to remove all the external boxes other than the switches in the fabric.
    
   3.c. For the selected leaf(switch_1), we do the following check:
             If any switch(switch_2) from the list obtained in 3.b. is in the non-cluster-leaf-list obtained in step 3.a.:
                 Form cluster between the two switches(switch_1 & switch_2) and remove this switch(switch_2) from the non-cluster-leaf-list

              i) Cluster is formed using the following command:
                 Command: switch %s cluster-create name %s cluster-node-1 %s cluster-node-2 %s
                 Output msg: ‘Created %s’
                     To create the name of the cluster, following step is done:
                     name = leaf_switch_1 + ‘-to’ + leaf_switch_2 + ‘-cluster’
                     (NOTE: There is an action item to strip off the last characters from the name if that exceeds the limit for the cluster name.)

   3.d. Steps 3.b. and 3.c. are repeated until the non-cluster-leaf-list is empty. Now we have all the clusters.


4. Implement the routing protocol based on the input from the user. The variable called ‘pn_routing_protocol’ is used to get the protocol name from the user. It can be ebgp or ospf.

    If the routing protocol is ebgp, then follow steps 5-8
    If the routing protocol is ospf, then follow steps 9-12


EBGP IMPLEMENTATION:

5. Make a dictionary to store BGP-AS num for all the switch. Initial value for BGP-AS range is taken as input from the user and used as follow:
   5.a. The BGP AS given by user is used as the BGP AS for all the spines(all the spines will have same BGP AS number)
   5.b. We find all the clusters. Then we find nodes in the each cluster and assign incremental values of BGP-AS to the nodes in the cluster.
        The leafs in the same cluster are assigned same BGP AS number.
            Commands: cluster-show format name no-show-headers
                                 cluster-show name %s format cluster-node-1,cluster-node-2 no-show-headers
   5.c. All the remaining leafs which are not the part of the cluster are assigned incremental values of BGP-AS now.


6. Configure extra parameters for ebgp like bgp-as, bgp-maxpath value and bgp-redistribute values for each vrouter(obtained from step 1):
Command: vrouter-modify name %s bgp-as %s bgp-max-paths %s bgp-redistribute %s
    bgp-maxpath and bgp-redistribute values are taken from user as input
    bgp-as value is taken from the dictionary from step 5


7. Add ebgp neighbors as follows:

   Start a loop which performs the following steps for every spines:

   7.a. Find the vrouter in the spine.
          Command: vrouter-show location %s format name no-show-headers
          Output: vrouter_spine

   7.b. Find all the l3-port in the spine_vrouter(@ref 7.a.) if a vrouter-interface is present over that l3-port
           Command: vrouter-interface-show vrouter-name %s format l3-port no-show-headers
           Output: port list

      For every port in the port list obtained in 7.b., perform the following the subtasks:

      7.c. Find the hostname for every port
             Command: switch %s port-show port %s format hostname
             Output: leaf

      7.d. Find the vrouter in the leaf(@ref 7.c.)
             Command: vrouter-show location %s format name

      7.e. Take the BGP-AS numbers of the spine and leaf from the dictionary containing the BGP-AS number(@ref 5)

      7.f. Find the ip of the vrouter-interface associated with the spine vrouter(@ref 7.a.) and the port
            Command: vrouter-interface-show vrouter-name %s l3-port %s format ip no-show-headers

      7.g. Process the obtained ip(@ref 7.f.) to get the ip assigned to vrouter-interface in the leaf.
           We have the assumption that if 10.0.0.1 is assigned to a interface in leaf then 10.0.0.2 will be assigned to a interface in spine.
             So, after getting the ip from the step 7.f. we can find leaf ip.

      7.h. Add bgp for spine
             Command: vrouter-bgp-add vrouter-name %s neighbor %s remote-as %s
                NOTE: If pn_bfd variable is set by the user then include the word ‘bfd’ in the command
             Output msg: Added BGP Neighbor %s for %s

      7.i. Add bgp for leaf
            Command: vrouter-bgp-add vrouter-name %s neighbor %s remote-as %s
                   NOTE: If pn_bfd variable is set by the user then include the word ‘bfd’ in the command
                               If the leaf is a part of any cluster then include ' weight 100 allowas-in ' in the command
             Output msg: Added BGP Neighbor %s for %s


8. Add ibgp neighbors. The neighborship is to be formed between the leafs switches which are in cluster as follows:

   8.a. Get the cluster list
          Command: cluster-show format name no-show-headers
          Output: cluster_list

   Find the nodes in each cluster. If the cluster is formed using the leaf switches then follow the following sub-steps:

   8.b. Process the iBGP IP RANGE obtained from the user. The ips should be divided in the subnet of 30. So, we have 2 usable ips in each subnet.

          The first ip is used as interface ip for the first node in the cluster and the second ip is used as the remote ip for ibgp neighborship.
           Similarly, The second ip is used as interface ip for second node in the cluster and the first ip is used as the remote ip for ibgp neighborship.
           eg: ibgp_ip_range: 172.168.0.1/24
                 Interface ip for first node: 172.168.0.1/30
                 Remote ip to form the neighborship: 172.168.0.2
                 Interface ip for second node: 172.168.0.2/30
                 Remote ip to form the neighborship: 172.168.0.1

   For each node in the cluster, follow the following substeps:

   8.c. Make the vlan using the ibgp vlan_id given by user:
          Command: switch %s vlan-create id %s scope local
          Output: ‘Created vlan with id %s’

   8.d. Find the vrouter in the cluster leaf switch
          Command: vrouter-show location %s format name

   8.e. Create the vrouter interface using ibgp interface ip from step 8.b.
          Command: vrouter-interface-add vrouter-name %s ip %s vlan %s
          Output msg: ‘Added vrouter interface with ip %s on %s’

   8.f. Add the vrouter ibgp neighbor using the remote ip from step 8.b.
         Command: vrouter-bgp-add vrouter-name %s neighbor %s remote-as %s next-hop-self
         Output: ‘Added iBGP neighbor %s for %s’


OSPF IMPLEMENTATION:

9. Made a dictionary to store the area-id of the leaf-switches to be assigned to them. Initial area-id is taken as input from the user and used as follow:
   NOTE: The nodes in the same cluster will have same area-id.

   9.a. We find all the clusters. Then we find nodes in the each cluster and assign incremental values of AREA-ID to the nodes in the cluster. The nodes in the same cluster will have same AREA-ID.
            Commands: cluster-show format name no-show-headers
                                 cluster-show name %s format cluster-node-1,cluster-node-2 no-show-headers
   9.b. All the remaining leafs which are not the part of the cluster are assigned incremental values now.


10. Add ospf neighbors as follows:

   Start a loop which performs the following steps for every spines:

   10.a. Find the vrouter in the spine.
          Command: vrouter-show location %s format name no-show-headers
          Output: vrouter_spine

   10.b. Find the loopback_network address assigned to the vrouters. (The loopback ips are already assigned to vrouters in the l3-ztp module.) 
          
          i) Find the loopback ip assigned to the first spine.
             Command: vrouter-loopback-interface-show vrouter-name %s format ip no-show-headers

          ii) Process the loopback-ip and form a network address with subnet-mask 24
                e.g.: if the loopback ip is 10.0.0.1 then the loopback network becomes 10.0.0.0/24

   10.c. Add ospf neighbour for loopback network in all the spines with ospf-area ‘0’. This is done to have inter-area communication in ospf.
          Command: vrouter-ospf-add vrouter-name network %s ospf-area %s

   10.d.. Find all the l3-port in the spine_vrouter(@ref 10.a.) if a vrouter-interface is present over that l3-port
                Command: vrouter-interface-show vrouter-name %s format l3-port no-show-headers
                Output: port list

      For every port in the port list obtained in 10.d., perform the following the subtasks:

      10.e. Find the hostname for every port
                  Command: switch %s port-show port %s format hostname
                  Output: leaf

      10.f. Find the vrouter in the leaf(@ref 10.e.)
             Command: vrouter-show location %s format name

      10.g. Take the area-id of the leaf(@ref 10.e.) from the dictionary containing the AREA-ID (@ref 9)

      10.h.. Find the ip of the vrouter-interface associated with the spine vrouter(@ref 10.a.) and the port
            Command: vrouter-interface-show vrouter-name %s l3-port %s format ip no-show-headers

      10.i. Process the obtained ip(@ref 10.h.) to get the ip assigned to interface in leaf and find the ospf-network.
            We have the assumption that if 10.0.0.1 is assigned to a interface in the leaf then 10.0.0.2 will be assigned to a interface in the spine.
              So, after getting the ip from the step 10.h. we can find leaf ip.
              e.g.: if the spine-interface ip is 172.168.0.6
                      leaf-interface ip is 172.168.0.5
                      ospf-network is 172.168.0.4

                       Command: vrouter-interface-config-show vrouter-name %s nic %s format ospf-bfd no-show-headers

                  II) Get the ospf-status
                       Command: vrouter-interface-config-show vrouter-name %s nic %s format ospf-bfd no-show-headers

                 III) Perform the following algorithm based on the value of the ospf-status(@ref II)
                             if the ospf-status is empty then:

                                  Output msg: ‘Added OSPF BFD config to %s’
                             else if ospf-status is not enable:

                                   Output msg: ‘Enabled OSPF BFD for %s’
                             else:
                                   Output msg: ‘Empty string’
             
             ii) Fire the ospf neighbourship add command:

                 Command: vrouter-ospf-add vrouter-name %s network %s ospf-area %s

                                 Output msg: ‘Added OSPF BFD config to %s’
                             else if ospf-status is not enable:

     Output msg: ‘Added ospf_redistribute to %s’


12. Add ospf-neighborship between the nodes in the leaf cluster(similar to iBGP). The neighborship is to be formed between the leafs switches which are in cluster as follows:

   12.a. Get the cluster list
          Command: cluster-show format name no-show-headers
          Output: cluster_list

   Find the nodes in each cluster. If the cluster is formed using the leaf switches then follow the following sub-steps:

   12.b. Process the OSPF IP RANGE for ospf-neighborship in leaf-cluster obtained from the user. The ips should be divided in the subnet of 30. So, we have 2 usable ips in each subnet.

          The first ip is used as interface ip for the first node in the cluster and the second ip is used as the remote ip for ibgp neighborship.
           Similarly, The second ip is used as interface ip for second node in the cluster and the first ip is used as the remote ip for ibgp neighborship.
           And the network with subnet of 30 is used as the ospf-network address.
           eg: ibgp_ip_range: 172.168.0.0/24
                 Ospf_network: 172.168.0.0/30
                 Interface ip for first node: 172.168.0.1/30
                 Remote ip to form the neighborship: 172.168.0.2
                 Interface ip for second node: 172.168.0.2/30
                 Remote ip to form the neighborship: 172.168.0.1

   For each node in the cluster, follow the following substeps:

   12.c. Make the vlan using the vlan_id given by user:

          Output msg: ‘Added vrouter interface with ip %s on %s’

    12.f. Add ospf

             i) If pn_bfd variable is set then configure bfd as follows(The value of pn_bfd is given by user (True/False)):
                   I) Find out the nic id of the vrouter-interface associated with the vrouter(@ref 12.d.) and spine ip(@ ref 12.b.)
                       Command: vrouter-interface-config-show vrouter-name %s nic %s format ospf-bfd no-show-headers

                  II) Get the ospf-status
                       Command: vrouter-interface-config-show vrouter-name %s nic %s format ospf-bfd no-show-headers

                 III) Perform the following algorithm based on the value of the ospf-status(@ref II)
                             if the ospf-status is empty then:
                                 Command: vrouter-interface-config-add vrouter-name %s nic %s ospf-bfd enable
                                 Output msg: ‘Added OSPF BFD config to %s’
                             else if ospf-status is not enable:
                                  Command: vrouter-interface-config-modify vrouter-name %s nic %s ospf-bfd enable
                                  Output msg: ‘Enabled OSPF BFD for %s’
                             else:
                                  Output msg: ‘Empty string’
             
             ii) Fire the ospf neighbourship add command:
                     Command: vrouter-ospf-add vrouter-name %s network %s ospf-area %s
